<h4>This repository contains several small projects. Rings, cache and files are used in these projects</h4>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> Compact password</li>
  <br>
<p>The algorithm counts the number of repetitions of all digits in the string, deletes the repeated digits and writes the number of repetitions of each digit (provided that it is repeated at least 2 times) in the input string and finally the numerical string Sorts in ascending order. 
This work is repeated on the obtained output again and continues until the final output does not differ from the output of the previous step.</p>
<p>input example: 442254545</p>
<p>output example: 22345</p>

<br>
  <li>Shopping cart</li>
  <br>
  <p>A program that simulates the shopping cart of a simple online store, including adding products, removing products, and calculating prices 
The entire shopping cart of a customer as well as the display of the customer's shopping cart.</p>
  <br>
<br>
  <li>grade student</li>
  <br>
  <p>
    1. Read the csv file and put its data in three separate dictionaries. 
    2. A dictionary contains the names and grades of all students. 
    3. A dictionary containing the names and grades of all students whose grades are between 17 and 20. 
    4. A dictionary containing the names and grades of all students whose grades are between 0 and 10.
    5. Finally, a search function has been defined to get the student's name and return its grade with the appropriate message.
  </p>
  <br>
<br>
  <li>cache</li>
  <br>
  <p>Implemented Fibonacci and Factorial functions with a recursive algorithm and overwrote the process_timer decorator, which logs the execution time of the function. 
Then cache is also used for caching functions
    </p>
</ul>
