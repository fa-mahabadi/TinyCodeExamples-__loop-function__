The algorithm counts the number of repetitions of all digits in the string, deletes the repeated digits and writes the number of repetitions of each digit (provided that it is repeated at least 2 times) in the input string and finally the numerical string Sorts in ascending order. 
This work is repeated on the obtained output again and continues until the final output does not differ from the output of the previous step.
<p>input example: 442254545</p>
<p>output example: 22345</p>
